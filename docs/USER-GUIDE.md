# MoveBit user guide

**English** · [简体中文](USER-GUIDE.zh-CN.md)

Water, stand-up and eye-rest reminders delivered by Mubi（沐比）, a small original character at the edge of your screen — never a fullscreen cover, never stolen focus, never intercepted input.

## Availability

v0.0.1. Free community application under MIT; no commercial activation or subscription.

## Platforms and installation

Official releases target Windows x64, macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux x64/arm64. Every platform ships a portable archive; Windows adds an MSI, macOS a DMG, Linux a deb, rpm and AppImage. Use the [official Releases](https://github.com/turinglambdaai/movebit/releases), select an explicitly listed OS/architecture asset, and check the supplied SHA-256 sidecars. Preview assets may lack publisher signing or notarization; do not disable system-wide security protections to install them.

Platform notes: idle detection uses the native desktop APIs (GetLastInputInfo / CoreGraphics / XScreenSaver). On Linux, Mubi's card docks on X11 sessions; on Wayland the compositor does not let an app place a click-through card, so cues deliver as in-app reminder cards instead (reminders, history and updates work as usual).

## Your first session

1. Install and launch. The compact first-run flow asks for a water interval (30/45/60 min), a sit interval (45/60/90 min) and whether cues make a sound — or press Skip for the defaults.
2. Meet Mubi. When a cycle is due, the character appears at the screen edge with a clear health suggestion and an actionable label. The card rests after a few seconds; Done / Later / Hide sit right on it.
3. Respond your way: **Done** (a self-report — never a measurement), **Later** (defers by the snooze interval), **Hide** (puts it away; the next cycle arrives on schedule). All three sit on the reminder card itself — the tray menu (Windows / macOS) reaches them too — and the character and its text stay pointer-through; only the action row accepts clicks.
4. Enable login startup only if you want background reminders. Treat the history charts as usage estimates, not health measurements.

## Mubi, focus mode and honesty

- The three gestures map to the three reminders: sit → stretch, water → raised cup, eye rest → closed eyes. Several due reminders merge into one cue with every meaning preserved.
- **Focus mode** (the tray toggle on Windows / macOS, a header button on Linux) queues cues silently during presentations and delivers ONE bounded summary when it ends — never a pile-up. Cues that were already on screen are not re-emitted.
- Unanswered cues expire after ten minutes and the next reminder arrives on its normal schedule. Silence never counts as completion, and nothing is lost.
- Personalize Mubi in settings: size S/M/L (body heights 60/78/104), motion (still/subtle/lively), dock position, label visibility. Reduce Motion (or motion "still") renders everything static.
- There is no fullscreen forced break anywhere in v0.0.1, and no way to opt back into one — that contract was removed on purpose.

## Work history

Today's active minutes, reminder counts and the 7/30-day charts live in the main window; history is retained for 370 days. Activity time counts only real keyboard/mouse presence — idle time past the away threshold (5 minutes by default) is treated as a real break and resets the cycles.

## Data, backup and recovery

Quit MoveBit and back up `config.json` and the `history/` folder: `~/Library/Application Support/movebit` on macOS, `~/.config/movebit` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\movebit` on Windows. The v1 config file carries a `SchemaVersion` marker; a file without it falls back to defaults rather than being half-migrated. Restore into a copy first.

## Network, keys and privacy

Reminder and accounting work is local. Update checks and release downloads contact GitHub Releases only. There is no account, no telemetry, no keystroke recording — idle detection asks the OS how long ago the last input was, nothing more. Mubi's panel never reads input.

## Updates and removal

The in-app **Check for updates** reads the Ed25519-signed `update-manifest.json`, verifies size and SHA-256 after download, and swaps the payload only through **Update & restart**. A failed check aborts without touching the current install. Removing the program does not erase the separate data directory; verify your backup before deleting personal data.
