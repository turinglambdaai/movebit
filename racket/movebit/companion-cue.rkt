#lang racket/base

;; MoveBit v1: choose HOW to present an already-due health reminder.
;;
;; The core product is hydration, standing/movement and eye-rest reminders,
;; not a desktop pet. The scheduler/orchestrator still own all timing, merging,
;; pause, snooze, idle and statistics; these choices do not reset any timer.
;; The native host is responsible for safe surfaces, input pass-through,
;; labels, accessibility and presentation capability reporting.
;;
;; v0.x was an experiment with no real users: there is deliberately no legacy
;; presentation flag or compatibility mode. Character-style cues are the
;; first real product default. On unsupported platforms use a non-blocking
;; native notification rather than an interactive or fullscreen overlay.
;;
;; This module also owns the two presentation-side policies the reminder
;; contract requires to be EXPLICIT (issue #55):
;;   - cue-expiry-ms: an unacknowledged cue stops being current after this
;;     much wall-clock time. Expiry closes the ledger entry only — the fired
;;     reminder already restarted its cycle, so the next reminder arrives on
;;     the normal schedule. Silence never counts as completion.
;;   - summarize-open-cues: when Focus/presentation silence ends, the queued
;;     cues collapse into ONE bounded summary cue carrying the union of their
;;     kinds — never a pile-up of every missed moment.
