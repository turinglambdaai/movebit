;; MoveBit update wiring over `rivet/distribution`, following the fulcrum
;; reference implementation.
;;
;; Trust model (inherited from Rivet): HTTPS protects transport but is not
;; the root of update trust. The channel manifest is Ed25519-signed and
;; verified against the public key embedded below before any version
;; decision. Key management lives in scripts/update-keys.sh: key generation,
;; the exact replacement of `current-update-public-key-hex`, and rotation via
;; the key id (ship a client trusting the next key before signing with it).
;;
;; The backend verifies and downloads the signed update artifact; the host
;; owns installation. A check fetches and verifies the signed channel
;; manifest; the artifact download runs on a background thread with progress
;; published to a state box that the UI polls through the `get-update-state`
;; RPC (RVT1 events are thread-local, so a background thread cannot emit
;; them directly). The feed serves portable archives per platform:
;;   Windows — the zip IS the install layout: `prepare-install!` extracts the
;;     verified archive into a staging directory and writes a helper script
;;     that waits for the app to exit, swaps the payload, and relaunches.
;;   macOS — same shape as Windows: the zip carries movebit.app, the helper
;;     swaps the bundle with a backup + rollback rename and relaunches.
;;   Linux — AppImage installs update through the sibling .AppImage release
;;     asset (downloaded, sidecar-checked, swapped over the running image);
;;     tarball/package installs stay manual, so `prepare-install!` refuses
;;     and the host hands off the downloaded file or shows guidance.

;;   Windows — the zip IS the install layout. Extract into
;;     <data-dir>/updates/staged/ and write apply-update.cmd: the helper
;;     waits for the running app to exit, robocopys the staged payload over
;;     the install directory, relaunches, and removes itself. Extract runs
;;     on the caller's thread (the prepare-update-install RPC worker).
;;   macOS — the zip carries movebit.app. Extract the same way (bsdtar reads
;;     zip on macOS too), then apply-update.sh copies the staged bundle onto
;;     the install volume and swaps it with a backup + rollback rename
;;     before relaunching via `open`.
;;   Linux — install is never automated here: AppImage swaps happened at
;;     download time, tarball/package installs stay manual (the host shows
;;     the downloaded file or the package-manager guidance), so
;;     `prepare-install!` refuses honestly.
