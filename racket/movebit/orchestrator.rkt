;; App-level orchestration around the scheduler: the same-tick merge rule and
;; the v1 cue lifecycle. The orchestrator is pure domain logic — no UI, no
;; rivet — so the same rules run identically on every host shell.
;;
;; Every tick's due reminders merge into ONE cue (kinds preserved, priority
;; ordered; snoozing a merged cue defers all of its kinds). Each cue then
;; moves through the explicit lifecycle pinned by issue #55:
;;
;;   due → pending → displayed → acknowledged | snoozed | expired
;;
;; `pending` = created, not yet confirmed on screen; `displayed` = the host
;; reported the cue visible. Done (acknowledge) is SELF-REPORTED — it never
;; proves water was drunk or a break taken, and it does not advance stats
;; (stats count fired reminders). Later (snooze) defers every merged kind by
;; the configured snooze via the scheduler's active-time semantics. Hide
;; (dismiss) and the ten-minute timeout both expire the cue without claiming
;; completion — the reminder's cycle already restarted at fire time, so the
;; next reminder arrives on the normal schedule and nothing is silently lost.
;;
;; Focus/presentation silence (quiet) changes presentation only: cues created
;; while quiet stay `pending` and are NOT emitted to the host. When quiet
;; ends they collapse into ONE bounded summary cue (companion-cue.rkt) —
;; never a pile-up. Quiet never fabricates completion and never drops a
;; due reminder's meaning.
